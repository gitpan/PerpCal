DESCRIPTION

This is another implementation of a perpetual calendar. However, dates
prior to September 3, 1752 (the Gregorian Reformation) were not taken
into consideration, thus, the day of week for them would be incorrectly
reported.

A return value of 0 means that the day of week is "Sunday". A return
value of 1 is "Monday", 2 is "Tuesday", 3 is "Wednesday", 4 is
"Thursday", 5 is "Friday", and 6 is "Saturday".

See the example directory for usage.
